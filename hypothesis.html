    While no final conclusion has been drawn yet, here is a list of questions I am considering and looking into with the data.</p> 
    <ul>
    <li>
       What ouside factors contribute to a lack of online presence with adults?
    </li>
    <li>
        How has the presence of older adults changed over the years? What are possible factors?
    </li>
    <li>
        Do the graphs show any correlation between race and online presence? What about a correlation between race and income?
    </li>
    <li>
        Is there any correlation between education level and online presence? Does income also play into this?
    </li>
    
    
    </ul>
