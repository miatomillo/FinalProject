    Surrounding enviornments and circumstances can heavily influence the online presence of adults.
    </h2>
    
    <p>
    According to the graphs and data, several trends are highlighted showing the correlation between several enviornmental factors, and the online presence of adults. To begin, I have included a graph showing the overall presence of adults aged 18+ for reference. This graph shows that adults are steadily becoming more present on the internet, which is important to consider when reading the graphs, as overall adults are going online with their lives more and more as the years go on. This is likely due to the increase in technology in our lives, with more and more things being virtual each and every year.

        In addition, since "adult" is a fairly large category, I have included a graph showing which age groups of adults are online more. At the top for most online presence is the age group of 18-29 years old, followed by 30-49 year olds, then 50-64 year olds, and finally at the bottom, adults 64+. This is likely due to the fact that the younger adults grew up with this technology, and the older ones had to adapt to this change as they got older.

        Next, we see a clear divide between race. The data surveys both white and african americans. According to the data, people who are white have a higher online presence.

        Looking at the income of adults also shows a divide in online presence. With the higher income individuals making up the higher percent, the rest of the data falls as expected, followed by the lower income having less of a presence. This is likely due to the fact that technology is expensive, and those adults wiht a higher income can afford all of the new things coming out, and keep up to date.

        With the gender graph, it is very close, and it can be proposed that there is no clear difference. However, the men show a slightly greater presence, which can be according to the fact that in the early years, technology was up to the men. We can see as the years go on, women catch up, taking the lead around 2020. This lead is likely due to the rise of social media, and online influencers which are mainly women on several social media platforms.

        Finally, we can take a look at education levels. The higher educated show a higher online presence, and so on. This most likely relates back to correlate with income. Typically, the higher educated you are, the more fit you are for a well paying job. Like previously stated, the high incomes have a greater percentage of adults online. So, it is no suprise that education provides this same simmilarity.
