    For this project, I have found a large amount of data looking into Social Media trends with adults. The data found looks over internet usage as a whole, but also breaks down data into comparing several different social media platforms. The graphs I have provided look into percentages of adults active online assorted by age, gender, income, race, and education levels. From this data, eah category can be assessed against one another, resulting in conclusions based on the correlations of different subjects. For the purpose of the data, "adult" is considered all persons over the age of 18, and the percentage is based out of the adults surveyred each year by the Pew Research study from which the data was gathered.
    The data portrays online presence as a whole. </p>
